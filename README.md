# Databases & API
The concepts of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Databases are closely connected because it provides an *abstraction* for the developers to communicate with the backend - all using something called **end-points**. 

During this assignment, we will be focusing mainly on **RESTful APIs** that uses HTTP requests to carry out simple interactions with the data such as create/read/update/delete (CRUD) operations. This repository will contain notes for some of the key points, as well as screenshots of my work.
